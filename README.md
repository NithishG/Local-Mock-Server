# Local Mock Server

Local Mock Server is a simple tool for creating mock server locally. With this you can create number of mock api's by configuring request method, request path, response status and JSON response body

This app spins up a server locally and saves all the JSON data locally on your system(on Desktop)

Uses
 - Before integrating with the real api, front-end developers can create a mock server to simulate each endpoint and its corresponding response body and also response status
 - Helps in reducing the dependency of UI team with the server team
